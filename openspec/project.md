# Project Context

## Purpose
The Cathedral of Circuits is a professional-grade creative-technology ecosystem designed for advanced software development, game creation, and technical innovation. It integrates modern web technologies, game development engines, and professional audio systems in a scalable, maintainable environment.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- React for interactive UI components
- Node.js for backend services and scripting
- Vite for fast build tooling
- Turbo for monorepo management
- Express for API endpoints
- Three.js for 3D visualizations and sacred geometry
- Azure OpenAI for AI-enhanced art and narrative generation
- PNPM for package management

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Flowing, spiral-based aesthetics over flat designs
- Trauma-safe defaults: no autoplay, reduced motion, ESC emergency stops
- Sacred geometry compliance: golden ratio (1.618) in compositions
- Consistent mystical theming with energy ribbons and breathing interfaces
- WCAG AA accessibility standards

### Architecture Patterns
- Trinity Architecture: Soul (Circuitum99), Body (Stone Grimoire), Spirit (Cosmogenesis)
- Modular packages with standalone functionality and seamless integration via tesseract-bridge
- Sacred mathematics: 144:99 ratio for calculations
- Component boundaries defined by Open Specification System

### Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for cross-app compatibility
- Sacred math validation for geometric accuracy
- Trauma safety checks for all interfaces
- Performance benchmarks and health checks
- Automated validation via pre-commit hooks and CI/CD

### Git Workflow
- Commit messages follow cathedral philosophy: 🌀 spiral:, 🛡️ safety:, ♿ access:, 🎨 femme:, 🧠 nd-safe:, 📚 docs:, ✨ cathedral:
- Branch protection with required status checks
- Pre-commit validation for ownership and sacred math
- Semantic versioning for components

## Domain Context
The project is a comprehensive software development ecosystem integrating modern web technologies, game development engines, and professional audio systems. It features real-time game mechanics, advanced audio processing, cross-platform web applications, and professional development tools. The system emphasizes clean architecture, performance optimization, and scalable deployment strategies across multiple platforms and devices.ctacle, while honoring the meta-narrative of the living grimoire.

## Important Constraints
- Trauma safety: ESC always exits, gentle defaults, no sudden motions
- Neurodivergent accommodations: motion controls, pause buttons, processing time
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast
- Azure AI integration: uncensored creativity, balanced processing, optional features
- Sacred accuracy: real correspondences, divine proportions, mystical authenticity

## External Dependencies
- Azure OpenAI for visionary art enhancement
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- Cloudflare Pages for static hosting
- Worker APIs for background processing
- Public domain research sources with full provenance
