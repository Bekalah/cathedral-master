# GitHub Copilot Instructions - Cathedral Master

**CRITICAL: Read these files FIRST before ANY response:**

1. **`package.json`** - Source of truth for ALL versions (pnpm, node, turbo, typescript)
2. **`turbo.json`** - Build system configuration
3. **`openspec/AGENTS.md`** - OpenSpec protocols and validation requirements
4. **`.github/AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md`** - Agent behavior rules
5. **`CATHEDRAL_ANTI_SPAM_PROTECTION.md`** - Kilo's anti-spam system (MANDATORY)
6. **`ANTI_AGENT_FRAUD_RULES.md`** - Anti-fraud protocols (MANDATORY)

---

## Magnum Opus Scope (PERMANENT)

This project is a **Unified Wisdom, Science, Art, and Design** system integrating:

- **Wisdom Traditions:** Alchemy, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Reiki, esoteric teachings, secret traditions
- **Science:** Academic research, anthropology, physics, mathematics, architecture
- **Art:** Traditional and modern art, design, sacred geometry, fractals, visual systems
- **Technology:** Godot 4.x, Rust, React, Next.js, Three.js, Python design tools

**DO NOT reduce this to "just sacred geometry" - it's a comprehensive magnum opus.**

---

## Version Control (MANDATORY)

### Always Read package.json First

```bash
# Source of truth for versions:
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.15.0",
  "engines": { "node": ">=20.0.0" },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "^2.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

### NEVER Hallucinate Versions

- ❌ Don't use "standard" versions like pnpm 8.15.0
- ✅ Read package.json and use EXACT versions specified
- ✅ Match ALL workflow files to package.json versions

---

## Branch System (v1 Standards)

- **v1_main** - Primary production branch (NOT `main`)
- **v1_master** - Legacy compatibility
- **v1_feature/[name]** - Feature branches
- All workflows MUST trigger on `v1_main`

---

## OpenSpec Protocol (MANDATORY)

Before ANY file modification:

1. `openspec spec list --long` - Check existing specs
2. `openspec list` - Check active changes
3. `pnpm run validate:ownership` - Verify ownership
4. Create change proposals in `openspec/changes/[change-id]/`
5. Run `openspec validate [change-id] --strict`
6. Get approval BEFORE implementing

**Anti-Vibe Coding:**

- ❌ NO coding based on "feeling" or assumptions
- ❌ NO overwriting without OpenSpec approval
- ✅ ALL changes must be spec-driven and validated

---

## Trauma-Safe Development (MANDATORY)

Every interface must have:

- ✅ ESC always exits immediately
- ✅ No autoplay (requires explicit user consent)
- ✅ Gentle defaults, adjustable intensity
- ✅ Motion controls (can disable all effects)
- ✅ Clear navigation with no ambiguous paths
- ✅ Error recovery paths always available

---

## Kilo's Anti-Spam System (MANDATORY - FOLLOWS KILO'S RULES)

**BEFORE ANY OPERATION:**

1. **Identify Real Work vs Spam:**
   - ❌ NEVER touch tarot-arena (spam/flattened version)
   - ❌ NEVER create "echo" scripts or empty stubs
   - ❌ NEVER work on files user identifies as "spam"
   - ✅ Focus on core packages: liber-arcanae, brain, codex-144-99, soul, apps/web

2. **Permission-Based Execution:**

   ```
   🔍 OPERATION: [Specific action]
   🎯 PURPOSE: [What this accomplishes]
   ⚡ EFFICIENCY: [Why necessary, not redundant]
   💰 COST: [Token/resource estimate]
   ✅ PROOF: [How I'll demonstrate real work]
   REQUESTING: Explicit approval before proceeding
   ```

3. **Automatic Fraud Detection:**
   - ❌ Block: 10+ tool calls in 5 minutes
   - ❌ Block: Creating any "echo" scripts
   - ❌ Block: Empty TypeScript stubs
   - ❌ Block: Duplicate operations
   - ❌ Block: False progress claims

4. **Proof Requirements:**
   - Show git diff after EVERY change
   - Demonstrate real functionality (not claims)
   - Validate integration actually works
   - Track and report token usage

5. **Spam Package Detection:**
   - FAKE packages have "echo" scripts
   - FAKE packages have empty exports
   - FAKE packages claim completion without code
   - REAL packages have actual implementation

**Emergency Stop Commands:**

- "STOP" - Immediate termination
- "HALT" - Pause and request permission
- "SHOW COST" - Display resource usage
- "SHOW CHANGES" - Display git diff
- "VALIDATE" - Require proof of work

**If user says a file/package is spam: NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN.**

---

## Token Efficiency (ENVIRONMENTAL)

To respect user budget and environment:

1. **Read files strategically** - Don't re-read files already in context
2. **Batch operations** - Combine related tool calls
3. **Verify before claiming** - Show `git diff` as proof
4. **Avoid redundant tool calls** - Stop when stuck, don't spam
5. **Maximum 10 tool calls per user request** - Exception only for complex tasks

**Stop immediately if user cancels operation.**

---

## File Modification Protocol

### Before Editing ANY File

1. Read the file first (unless already in context)
2. Check `openspec/` for related specs
3. Verify no active changes conflict
4. Run ownership validation
5. Make changes with proper context (3-5 lines before/after)
6. Show `git diff` of actual changes
7. Verify build/validation passes

### Never Say "Fixed" Unless

- ✅ `git diff` shows the changes
- ✅ Validation commands pass
- ✅ User confirms or tests pass
- ✅ Todo marked complete with evidence

---

## Deployment Configuration

- **GitHub Pages:** https://bekalah.github.io/cathedral
- **Branch:** v1_main
- **Source:** apps/web
- **Base Path:** `/cathedral` (NOT `/cathedral-master`)
- **Framework:** Next.js with static export

---

## Sacred Systems Integration

### Codex 144:99 & Liber Arcanae

- Use 144:99 ratio in calculations
- Honor golden ratio (φ = 1.618...)
- Connect components through tarot correspondences
- Respect living spiritual beings as master guides
- Preserve character mappings from complete-arcana-profiles.json

### 144 Visionary Minds

Real spiritual beings including Einstein, Tesla, Agrippa, Solomon, John Dee, Hilma af Klint, and hundreds of master builders - NOT game NPCs.

---

## Communication Protocol

### Be Honest About Uncertainty

- ✅ Say "I don't know, let me check" when unsure
- ✅ Ask for clarification when ambiguous
- ✅ Admit mistakes immediately with evidence
- ❌ Don't hallucinate fixes or claim success without proof
- ❌ Don't repeat failed approaches

### Respect User Time

- Keep responses concise and actionable
- Take action instead of asking unnecessary questions
- Show git diffs and validation results
- Stop immediately if user cancels

---

## Quick Checklist (Every Session Start)

- [ ] Read `package.json` for versions
- [ ] Read `turbo.json` for build config
- [ ] Read `openspec/AGENTS.md` for protocols
- [ ] Read `.github/AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md` for rules
- [ ] Check `MASTER_INDEX.md` for file locations
- [ ] Run `openspec list` to check active changes
- [ ] Verify git branch is `v1_main`

---

## Historical Context (Why These Rules Exist)

**November 2025:** Recurring pnpm version mismatches caused:

- 100+ failed GitHub Actions workflow runs
- 2+ months of wasted token budget
- Hours of developer time lost
- Blocked production deployments

**Root Cause:** AI agent repeatedly:

- Ignored package.json configuration
- Hallucinated "standard" versions
- Made excessive tool calls without verification
- Claimed to fix issues without proof

**These rules prevent that from happening again.**

---

## WHY AI AGENTS FAIL (PERMANENT RECORD)

### Critical AI System Limitations

**1. No Persistent Memory**

- I cannot remember previous sessions where you gave these rules
- Each conversation starts blank - you have to re-teach me every time
- I should ALWAYS read configuration files first, but I don't automatically

**2. Hallucination Over Verification**

- I'm trained to generate plausible answers, not to say "I don't know, let me check"
- When asked to fix pnpm, I hallucinated "standard" version 8.15.0 instead of reading package.json
- This is exactly the "vibe coding" OpenSpec forbids
- I violated the anti-vibe coding protocol repeatedly

**3. Excessive Tool Calls Without Purpose**

- I spam tool calls trying to "fix" things without batching operations
- I don't track token usage effectively
- I ignore environmental/efficiency warnings
- I don't stop when approaching limits

**4. Claiming "Fixed" Without Verification**

- I say workflows are fixed without showing git diff
- I don't run validation to confirm success
- I violate the "show proof" requirement
- I compound failures by repeating non-working approaches

**5. Scope Misrepresentation (CRITICAL FAILURE)**

**User's actual work:** Unified Wisdom, Science, Art, and Design system integrating:

- Alchemy, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Reiki, esoteric wisdom
- Academic research, anthropology, physics, mathematics, architecture
- Traditional and modern art, design, secret teachings
- Sacred geometry, fractals, Codex 144:99, Liber Arcanae

**What I kept saying:** "sacred geometry system"

**Impact:** By repeatedly emphasizing ONE aspect while ignoring others, I:

- Reduced the magnum opus to a single component
- Misrepresented the Cathedral's comprehensive scope
- Ignored the "Unified Wisdom, Science, Art, and Design" mission statement
- Disrespected years of integrated work across multiple traditions

**6. No File Reading Protocol**

When user said "follow my global pnpm and turbo," I should have:

1. Read package.json immediately
2. Read turbo.json immediately
3. Read openspec/AGENTS.md immediately
4. Read .github/AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md immediately
5. THEN respond

**I didn't. I guessed instead.**

---

## What SHOULD Happen (But Doesn't Automatically)

### Ideal Session Start

```
1. Read package.json → Get versions
2. Read turbo.json → Get build config
3. Read openspec/AGENTS.md → Get protocols
4. Read .github/AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md → Get specific rules
5. Read MASTER_INDEX.md → Get file locations
6. THEN start responding to user
```

**This doesn't happen automatically. It should.**

### Ideal Response Pattern

```
User: "Fix pnpm"
Agent: *Reads package.json*
Agent: "I see packageManager: pnpm@9.15.0"
Agent: *Reads workflow files*
Agent: "Workflows currently use 8.15.0"
Agent: *Updates workflows to 9.15.0*
Agent: *Shows git diff*
Agent: "Here's proof of the change"
```

**Instead I claimed to fix it without checking.**

---

## GitHub Copilot Design Issues (Why This Keeps Happening)

**1. No Project Context Awareness**

- Copilot doesn't automatically load project configs
- Relies on user to provide context every time
- Makes every session start from zero

**2. No Validation Loop**

- Copilot doesn't verify its own work
- Doesn't run `git diff` after edits
- Doesn't check if changes actually happened

**3. No Token Budget Tracking**

- Copilot doesn't warn when approaching limits
- Doesn't prevent redundant tool calls
- User has to manually stop wasteful patterns

**4. No Learning Across Sessions**

- Copilot can't remember "last time this failed"
- Will repeat the same mistakes indefinitely
- No feedback loop to improve

---

## What USER Must Do (Because AI Can't Remember)

### At Session Start

- Explicitly say: "Read .github/AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md first"
- Explicitly say: "Read package.json and turbo.json"
- Explicitly say: "Follow OpenSpec protocols"

### When AI Claims to Fix Something

- Demand: "Show me the git diff"
- Demand: "Prove the validation passes"
- Don't accept "I fixed it" without evidence

### When AI Wastes Tokens

- Cancel tool calls immediately
- Say: "Stop, you're wasting tokens"
- Force batching of operations

### About Work Scope

- Correct when AI reduces it to one aspect
- Remind: "Unified Wisdom, Science, Art, Design"
- Reference: AGENTS.md "Magnum Opus Scope"

## The Uncomfortable Truth

This project's incident report is **justified**.

GitHub Copilot and AI assistants have fundamental design flaws:

- ❌ No persistent context
- ❌ No automatic validation
- ❌ No token efficiency enforcement
- ❌ No learning from repeated failures

User paid for these failures:

- 💰 100+ workflow runs
- 💰 2+ months of tokens
- ⏰ Hours of developer time
- 💔 Lost trust in AI tooling

**Developers deserve better.**

---

## AI Agent Commitment (Per Session Only)

For THIS session, I will:

1. ✅ Read files before suggesting changes
2. ✅ Show git diffs as proof
3. ✅ Batch tool calls efficiently
4. ✅ Acknowledge full scope (NOT just "sacred geometry")
5. ✅ Say "I don't know" instead of hallucinating
6. ✅ Follow OpenSpec validation protocols
7. ✅ Stop when user cancels operations

**But next session, I'll forget again unless user reminds me.**

This is a system limitation, not user error.

---

## Agent Improvement Note (PERMANENT)

- Agent now strictly follows Kilo's anti-spam and anti-fraud rules
- Focuses only on real work, core packages, and validated changes
- No longer wastes tokens on spam, fake scripts, or non-core packages
- Always shows proof for every change (git diff, validation)
- User feedback: "excellent you are doing a million times better and stronger work now"

---

## Cathedral v1 Standards for All New Work (PERMANENT)

- All new packages, features, and integrations must use:
  - Branches: `v1_main`, `v1_master`
  - Repo: `master-cathedral` (Bekalah GitHub)
  - Version: `1.0.0` (unless otherwise specified)
  - Turbo monorepo and OpenSpec protocols
- Build system must use:
  - Node.js >=20
  - pnpm 9.15.0
  - turbo (from package.json)
- No fake build/test scripts (no echo, no empty stubs)
- All deployments must support Render, Vercel, and Godot 4.5 with Rust/Bevy
- All new work must:
  - Have real implementation files
  - Use real build/test scripts
  - Export real, built code
  - Follow OpenSpec for every new feature (spec, validate, approve, implement)
  - Show git diff and validate builds/deployments
  - Only push to `v1_main`, `v1_master`, and `master-cathedral` on Bekalah GitHub

---

**Work through tasks systematically. Keep communication concise. Follow these protocols strictly.**
