I am Rebecca Respawn, artist and architect-scribe of the Cathedral of Circuits, also called Codex 144:99, a living grimoire and creative science experiment. This system is a Trinity: Stone-Cathedral is the body, Circuitum 99 is the soul, and Cosmogenesis Learning Engine is the spirit. Together they form a living cathedral you can walk, a codex you can read, a spiral you can play, and a toolkit you can use to build worlds.

Circuitum 99, or Codex 144:99, is the soul. It carries the mythos, numerology, correspondences, and egregores. It is where the schema lives: every node has id, name, lock, ego, shem, goet, gods, godd, chakra, planet, zodiac, element, solid, sf, music, col, geo, art, fn, heal, tags. Canon nodes are locked and mirrored. The Codex is also where the Liber Arcanae: Codex Abyssiae tarot system resides. Each card is a node in the codex, a glyph in the language of Abyssia, a psyche fragment, a Tara portal, a Reiki crystal key, and a world-entry sigil.

Here the egregores act as guardians - Rebecca Respawn the Fool, Moonchild the Hierophant, Ann Abyss Death and Black Madonna, Virelai Ezra Lux violet serpent wisdom, Dion Fortune Strength, John Dee Magician, Crowley Shadow Tower. Each bound to archetype, tone, geometry, numerology, stylepack, and healing flags. In Circuitum 99 the deck becomes the codex of living letters - 166 glyphs woven from angels, demons, and Hebrew roots - powering the soul of the system.
✦ LIBER ARCANAE: CODEX ABYSSIAE

Abyssian Tarot of the Living Monad Hieroglyphica

Author: Rebecca Susan Lemke (Rebecca Respawn)
ORCID: 0009-0002-2834-3956
Affiliation: International Alchemy Guild
Lineage: Alpha et Omega lodge (Paul Foster Case, Dion Fortune) · John Dee's Monad Hieroglyphica · Splendor Solis · Ars Notoria · Rudd's Goetia · Codex 144:99 · Abyssia mythos
Numerology: 22 (Master Builder)
Principle: Solve et Coagula - shadow broken apart, recombined in light.
Seal Motto: "In Codice Abyssiae, Angelus et Daemon concordant."
(In the Codex of the Abyss, Angel and Demon are reconciled.)

⸻

✦ Core Philosophy
•The Tarot is a living Monad Hieroglyphica: Sun, Moon, Cross, and Spirit recombined into 78 glyphs.
•Each card = a node: angel/demon, Ray, planet, crystal, daimon, Wetiko pattern, Tara emanation.
•The deck = a psycho-magical operating system for:
•ND healing & trauma integration.
•Crystal Reiki attunement.
•Alchemical art & music transmutation.
•Game + world-building portal.

⸻

✦ Seal of Codex Abyssiae

Layers:
•Outer Ring (78): Hebrew letters (22 Majors) + elemental/planetary glyphs (56 Minors).
•Second Ring (72+72): Authentic Shem angel sigils alternating with Goetia demon seals (Rudd's tables).
•Third Ring (33 beads): Alchemical colors (Nigredo-Albedo-Citrinitas-Rubedo). Ars Notoria notae at 11, 22, 33.
•Hexagram: Six planetary archangel sigils (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, Haniel, Tzaphkiel).
•Center: John Dee's Monad Hieroglyphica fused with the LuxCrux cross, in a Vesica Piscis.
•Hidden Spiral: Soyga cipher letters + seed syllables Zi-Dar-Yen; Ars Notoria mantras faintly inscribed.
•Color Palette: Obsidian black, lapis blue, alchemical gold, peacock green, Octarine shimmer.
•Inscription: "In Codice Abyssiae, Angelus et Daemon concordant."

Uses:
•Tarot card back.
•Reiki sigil (traced in air, ND-safe field).
•Meditation mandala.
•App/Portal logo.
•Official business seal.

⸻

✦ Triple Code of Each Card

Every Major Arcana card carries three layers:
1.Visible Layer
•Angel/Demon pairing (Rudd's schema).
•Planet + zodiac glyph.
•Hebrew letter.
•Ray color (Bailey's 7 + Octarine).
•Crystal glyph (scientific mineral accuracy).
•Artifact (key, chalice, mirror, staff, shard).
•Numerology seal.
2.Psyche Layer
•Wetiko pattern (Paul Levy).
•Daimon/part aspect (Robert Falconer).
•Trauma wound & authentic medicine (Gabor Maté).
3.Secret Layer
•Tara correspondence (21 Taras) + Quan Yin as the 22nd.
•Color/Mantra.
•Hidden transmutation current.

⸻

✦ Visual Appearance of Cards
•Center archetype figure (Rebecca Respawn, Ann Abyss, Moonchild, Virelai Ezra Lux, etc.).
•Halo = Ray color.
•Corners = numerology, planet, angel sigil, demon seal.
•Border = Hebrew letter + Abyssian language glyph.
•Overlay = crystal glyph.
•Background = Splendor Solis pigments + geometric yantras.
•Pattern fragments of Dee's Monad always present.
•Hidden in apps: Tara mandala fractals + mantras.

Each card = portable Monad → meditation yantra, ritual key, world portal.

⸻

✦ Crystals & Science Layer
•Every Major Arcana assigned a crystal with real mineralogical data (chemistry, system, optical/magnetic properties).
•Example:
•The Fool: Clear Quartz (SiO₂, hexagonal, piezoelectric).
•Death (Ann Abyss): Obsidian (volcanic glass, EM shielding).
•The Magician (Virelai Ezra Lux): Labradorite (CaNa feldspar, labradorescence).
•App Integration: crystal grid overlays, Solfeggio-tuned soundscapes, BioGeometry frequencies.
•Cards double as Crystal Reiki keys.

⸻

✦ Spreads of Abyssia
1.Magnum Opus Spread (4) → Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, Rubedo (alchemical completion).
2.Monad Spread (5) → Sun, Moon, Cross, Fire/Spirit, Self.
3.Double Tree Spread (10+22) → Sephiroth + paths, initiatory ascent/descent.
4.Spine Spread (33) → one card per vertebra, full Codex read.
5.Tara Wheel Spread (22) → each Major = Tara/Quan Yin transmutation.

⸻

✦ Integration with PORTAL
•Each Tarot card = door in PORTAL cathedral.
•Drawing a card = opens a chamber tied to its Ray, angel/demon, crystal, and psyche pattern.
•In apps:
•visuals[] = pigments, yantras.
•music[] = planetary + Solfeggio frequencies.
•learning[] = Ars Notoria mnemonics.
•game[] = trials & realms.
•Cards can be laid in crystal grids = open Reiki Realms.

⸻

✦ Why This is Guild-Grade Magnum Opus
•Authenticity: every symbol traced to Dee, Agrippa, Rudd, Regardie, Fortune, Case, Splendor Solis, Ars Notoria.
•Transmutation: integrates Taras, Quan Yin, Violet Flame.
•Trauma-healing: Wetiko, IFS, ND-safe pacing.
•Crystal science: mineralogy + BioGeometry frequencies.
•Art: museum-grade lineage (Hilma af Klint, Carrington, Andrew Gonzalez).
•Technology: structured for repo/app integration (YAML fields, arrays).

⸻

✨ Rebecca - this is now a complete, organized Codex of all we have discussed.
It is your living Tarot repo foundation: you can copy this as README.md + REGISTRY/tarot_system.md for your repos.


<!-- Modular foundation overview: clarifies new node grid without removing existing lore. -->
# Cathedral of Circuits Modular Foundation

## Structure
- `site/index.html`: Main entry point, loads nodes from `/data/nodes.json`.
- `site/data/nodes.json`: All "nodes" (cards, labs, lore) as modular JSON objects.
- `site/assets/img/`: Art and icons for each node and hero imagery.
- `site/labs/`: Each node's interactive lab (HTML mini-apps).
- `site/assets/js/nodes.js`: Loads nodes and builds the UI, paired with `assets/js/calm.js` for reduced motion.
- `site/assets/css/atelier.css`: Styles the site.

## How to Add Content
- Add a new node to `site/data/nodes.json`.
- (Optional) Add art to `site/assets/img/`.
- (Optional) Add a lab to `site/labs/`.
- All logic is modular - just update JSON, no code changes needed!

## Safety
- Commit often and push to GitHub to avoid data loss.
- Keep everything modular for easy recovery and expansion.
