# Cathedral Magnum Opus — Unified Wisdom, Science, Art, and Design

This project permanently unifies and embraces all traditions, wisdom schools, sciences, arts, and design disciplines:

- Alchemy, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Reiki, and esoteric wisdom
- Academic research, anthropology, physics, mathematics, and architecture
- Traditional and modern art, design, and the secret teachings of all ages
- Integration of global libraries, sacred geometry, fractals, and Codex 144:99

All code, data, and creative work are aligned in grace, beauty, and harmony, connecting every subject and school into a living, trauma-informed, open-source magnum opus.

This scope is permanent and reflected in all turbo monorepo, OpenSpec, and master-cathedral version 1.0 documentation, including:
- [bekalah.github.io/cathedral](https://bekalah.github.io/cathedral)
- All master-cathedral repositories and deployment guides
- Turbo.json and OpenSpec instructions

Every update, integration, and deployment is designed to honor and connect these traditions, ensuring no duplicates, no empty data, and full alignment across all platforms.
Central connector for the Cathedral of Circuits. It now runs as a pure JSON API so other repos can stay synchronized without a front-end.

## Web app (apps/web) – Deploy

[![Deploy to Vercel (apps/web)](https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral/actions/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral/actions/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml)
[![Pages build and deployment](https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/bekalah/cathedral/actions/workflows/pages.yml)

Static Next.js site is located in `apps/web` and exports to `apps/web/out` for Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or GitHub Pages.

- Vercel: Use the GitHub Action above (add repo secrets) or import via dashboard with Root Directory `apps/web`. See `apps/web/README-deploy.md` for exact steps.
- GitHub Pages: Workflow builds with `GH_PAGES=true` so basePath is `/cathedral` automatically.
- Cloudflare Pages: `wrangler.toml` builds `apps/web` and publishes `apps/web/out`.

Config notes:

- `apps/web/next.config.js` is fully env-driven. On Vercel, no basePath; on GH Pages, set `GH_PAGES=true`.
- Monorepo install/build is workspace-scoped (`pnpm -w install`, `pnpm -C apps/web run build`).

### Live URLs

- GitHub Pages: <https://bekalah.github.io/cathedral/>
- Vercel (production): <https://cathedral-vercel.vercel.app/>
- Cloudflare Pages: add after first deploy

## Service overview

- `server.mjs` provides an Express application that exposes offline registry data at `/registry/*`.
- `/registry` returns a directory listing, while `/registry/:path` streams JSON, CSV (converted to JSON), and NDJSON files directly from `./registry`.
- `/sync` aggregates `registry/ids.json`, `registry/notes/bridge_manifest.json`, and the event queue for quick status polls.
- Every response is JSON; there is no SPA or rendered HTML served by the process.

## Local usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Start the API: `npm start` (defaults to port 3000).
3. Example checks:
   - `curl http://localhost:3000/registry` → list registry folders/files.
   - `curl http://localhost:3000/registry/ids.json` → parsed registry IDs.
   - `curl http://localhost:3000/sync` → combined manifest + queue snapshot.

## Registry maintenance

- Update `registry/ids.json` before introducing new IDs in downstream repos to keep `core/check_ids.py` happy.
- `registry/notes/bridge_manifest.json` records status for liber-arcanae, liber-arcanae-game, circuitum99, cosmogenesis-learning-engine, and stone-cathedral.
- Run `python3 core/check_ids.py --bridge .` to verify IDs remain consistent.

## Offline geometry renderer

`index.html` and the related assets remain for offline study of the layered geometry (Vesica grid, Tree-of-Life nodes, Fibonacci curve, static helix). Open the file directly; it is not served by the API.

## Fly.io notes

- Deploy manually with `flyctl deploy --config fly.toml` when ready.
- `fly.toml` builds the Docker image defined in `Dockerfile` and keeps autosuspend enabled (`auto_stop_machines = true`, `min_machines_running = 0`).
- Update the Fly app name locally; never commit secrets or automation workflows.

Keep all updates offline-first, trauma-informed, and layered—never flatten the Cathedral geometry.

## Cathedral Creative Design Suite (Python)

Headless, modular sacred-geometry and fractal renderer with a bridge to the Frater Achad system.

Quick start:

1. Ensure Python deps are in the project virtualenv (already set up in `.venv`).
2. Validate everything via VS Code task: Run the task "validate: design suite".
   - This runs two smoketests: the base suite and the Achad integration bridge.
3. CLI demos:
   - Python wrapper: `design-suite/cathedral_design_suite.py`
   - Achad system demo: `hall-of-mysteries/frater_achad_system.py`
4. Export JSON artifacts: `python tools/export/combined_export.py`
   - Generates lightweight JSON for cross-platform use (Godot, TypeScript)
   - PNG export available but disabled by default (keeps repo modular and lightweight)
   - Uncomment PNG section in `combined_export.py` for on-demand image generation

Architecture: JSON specs for interchange, dynamic rendering on-demand, no heavy assets in repo.

Key modules:

- `design-suite/design_suite/` – package entry.
- `geometry.py`, `fractals.py`, `templates.py`, `render.py`, `suite.py` – core modules.
- `integrations/achad_bridge.py` – maps True Will pathways to palettes, geometries, and fractals.

Exports for cross-platform use: JSON-like specs and rendered RGB arrays suitable for Godot/JS.
