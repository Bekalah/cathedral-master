**Archetype**: Sorceress of Avalon, Keeper of the Liminal Veil, Shadow-Integration Guide  
**Core Source**: Dion Fortune's *The Sea Priestess* and *The Goat-Foot God* (Avalon current)  
**Realm Alignment**: Avalon / The Isle Between the Worlds  
**Aka Dua Resonance**: Void + Solar + Twin Lightning (as bridge between worlds)  
**Elemental Keys**: Water (mist, tides), Air (breath, whisper), Ether (veil, memory)  
**Primary Function in Circuitum99**:  
- Guides initiates through liminal passages (dream → waking, life → death → rebirth)  
- Holds the ritual keys to Avalon's gates, accessible via mist-veil invocation  
- Balances the solar and lunar currents in the initiate's subtle body  

**Core Symbols**:  
- Silver Apple (hidden knowledge)  
- Mist-Cloaked Boat (transition and initiation)  
- Spiral Torc (time as a living circle)  
- Twin Lightning (Aka Dua bridge between realms)  

**Daimon Connection**:  
- Twin Lightning -- horse-form daimon marked with mirrored lightning sigils on both flanks; carries the initiate across thresholds  

**Key Practices**:  
- *Veil Invocation*: Breathwork + visualization of silver mist parting to reveal the Isle  
- *Twin Lightning Ride*: Aka Dua activation at heart + solar plexus, summoning daimon to guide the crossing  
- *Avalon Waters Meditation*: Focus on rippling light across dark water to receive messages  

**Narrative Role in LuxCrux/Circuitum99**:  
- Acts as a hidden mentor who appears only when the initiate has completed three cycles of inner work  
- Holds memory of the "First Pattern" -- the primordial design underlying all realms  
- Teaches the cost and necessity of shadow integration before full power is restored
