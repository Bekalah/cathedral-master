# Silver Violet Flame Layer

## 📖 Core Summary
The **Silver Violet Flame** is a Reiki modality that channels a high-frequency transmutational energy, blending **violet flame alchemy** (Saint Germain) with the purifying clarity of silver light. It's used to cleanse karmic residue, dissolve energetic cords, heal trauma imprints, and accelerate spiritual transformation.

It is closely tied to **Quan Yin** in her compassionate aspect, as well as **the Violet Witch** in *Circuitum99* mythos.

## 🔑 Key Principles
- **Violet Flame:** Transmutation, forgiveness, alchemical fire that changes energy from lower to higher states.  
- **Silver Ray:** Purity, reflective truth, divine feminine balance, psychic shielding.  
- **Quan Yin Connection:** Compassion without enabling, deep mercy work, gentle power.  
- **Past-Life & Karmic Healing:** Dissolves old vows, removes hooks from soul memory.  
- **Integration with Reiki:** Can be used as a standalone or combined with Usui and elemental symbols.

## 🔮 Symbolism in Circuitum99
- **Violet Witch (Virelai Ezra Lux):** Keeper of the Octarine/Violet Ray, serpent daimon of wisdom, aligned with Sophia and the Raku Dragon IGNI.  
- **Quan Yin Archetype:** Embodied in the Siren Goddess, balancing IGNI's fire with oceanic compassion.  
- **Moonchild's Protection:** Silver resonance woven into meta-layers as reflective armor against psychic infiltration.  
- **Saint Germain Link:** Works in the same spiritual current as Aka Dua *Solar* and *Luminous* frequencies.
