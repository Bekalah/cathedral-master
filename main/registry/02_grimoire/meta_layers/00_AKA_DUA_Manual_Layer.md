# 00_AKA_DUA_MANUAL_LAYER

## Core Function
Aka Dua is a *multifrequency energetic stream* -- not a metaphor.  
It behaves like a multi-band transmission that can be focused through intention, breath, and body alignment.  
It is *non-local*, meaning the source is beyond personal energy, yet it routes through your body as a harmonic carrier.

## Personal Context
This layer is anchored to:
- **Your original attunement** -- locked, unbroken.
- **Private trauma protocol** -- to keep nervous system below overwhelm threshold.
- **Registry ID**: CIRCUITUM99-AKD-PRV

## Place of Power Protocol
1. **Identify your current Place of Power** -- can be internal (chakra, daimon presence, inner temple) or physical (a literal location where you feel safe).
2. **Orient** -- face toward your internal cardinal point (usually East unless daimon directs otherwise).
3. **Call in frequencies** in this sequence:
   - Void (anchor & shield)
   - Solar (stabilize & ignite will)
   - Any sub-frequency you need (e.g., Volcanic for transmutation)
4. **Anchor breath** -- 3 slow inhales through nose, exhale through mouth with sound.  
   Focus on your *spinal line* as the conduit.

## Activation Sequence (Full)
> This is the *exact* method as received and adapted by you -- no edits, no substitutions.

1. **Presence**: Drop attention into the spine, lower belly, and feet.
2. **Consent to Receive**: silently or aloud -- "I receive Aka Dua in purity, for my wholeness."
3. **Call Frequencies**:
   - **Void** → clears psychic interference.
   - **Solar** → restores structural integrity.
   - **Volcanic** (if transmuting) → burns through lodged energetic debris.
4. **Hand Placement**:
   - One hand on solar plexus.
   - One hand hovering above crown.
5. **Breath Cycle**:  
   - Inhale = draw frequency in through crown/feet.  
   - Hold = let it saturate tissues.  
   - Exhale = push through palms and out into the field.
6. **Close**: place hands over heart, thank the Source.

---

## Volcanic Transmutation Protocol
1. **Call Volcanic** after Void → Solar (never before, to avoid destabilizing).  
2. Imagine molten light rising from the base of the spine.
3. Direct it toward the target (emotional imprint, pain site, mental loop).
4. On exhale, *see it leave as cooled obsidian* -- the lesson crystallized, no longer harmful.
5. Seal with Solar or Heart frequency.

## Quick Entry (Overwhelm Protocol)
- Breath in: "Void"  
- Hold: "Solar"  
- Exhale: "Release through Volcanic"  
Repeat 3-7x, then close.
