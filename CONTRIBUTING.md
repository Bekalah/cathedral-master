### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build Circuitum99
cd apps/circuitum99 && pnpm run build

# Develop in Godot
cd godot && godot
```

### Key Technologies

- **Godot 4.5.0**: Game engine with Forward+ rendering

### The Circuitum Itself

**A single, evolving being composed of all creators**, where every historical creator becomes a node in one meta-story - the ultimate fusion of art, science, spirituality, and consciousness.

This is NOT a consciousness evolution platform or therapeutic system. This is a complete, working Fable-style RPG game with real historical figures as characters.
