🜍 Circuitum 99 - Cathedral Annex (Unified)

A living codex of art standards, chapel schematics, and archive references.
For use in Stone Grimoire / Codex 144:99 (museum-grade, ND-friendly).

⸻

I. Open Source Art Index (Approved Archive)

Purpose: All visual and symbolic resources used in the Codex must come from safe, public-domain, or explicitly licensed sources.
This guarantees museum-grade provenance, sponsor safety, and neurodivergent-safe alignment.

Categories:
    • ✦ PD Engravings → Fludd, Dürer, Ripley Scroll fragments.
    • ✦ Visionary Abstraction → Hilma af Klint, Emma Kunz (patterns + spirals).
    • ✦ Occult Geometry → Villard de Honnecourt sketchbook, Book of Soyga grids.
    • ✦ Sacred Textures → Rosslyn carvings, Gothic tracery, alchemical marginalia.
    • ✦ Color Archives → Munsell spectral wheels, medieval pigment studies.

Integration:
    • /docs/open_source_art_index.md holds the canonical list.
    • Each plaque or chapel page cites which archive entry it derives from.
    • Index is linked to the museum checklist for auditing.

II. Apprentice Pillar Chapel (Rosslyn Integration)

Page: /chapels/apprentice-pillar.html
Theme: Rosslyn's Apprentice Pillar as a living ladder.
    • Geometry: Helix vine = Prima Materia ascent.
    • Numerology: Mapped to Jacob's Ladder and the 33-vertebrae spine.
    • Hermetic Role: Entry point for the alchemical journey (Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo).
    • Plaque Note: "The Apprentice Pillar is not failure - it is the beginning. Its spiral holds the prima materia of all further ascent."

Style:
    • Museum-grade parchment layout.
    • Hilma spiral overlays + subtle neon tracery.
    • ND-safe: high contrast skins available; tone gated on gesture.

📍 Save this document as:
README_ANNEX.md in your repo root.

Do you want me to expand this annex into a template so every new chapel, pillar, or realm page automatically has:
    1. Museum checklist
    2. Plaque note
    3. Stylepack reference
    4. Provenance citat
