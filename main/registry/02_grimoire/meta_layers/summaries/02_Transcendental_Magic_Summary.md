# Transcendental Magic -- Summary (Éliphas Lévi)

## One Breath
Lévi's "Dogme et Rituel" unites Kabbalah, Tarot, and ceremonial practice into a formula: **Magic = Will + Imagination acting on the Astral Light**. Doctrine = metaphysics; Ritual = applied tools.

## Core Pillars
- **Astral Light**: Subtle medium storing & transmitting forms.
- **Will + Imagination**: The true wand & cup; balanced they imprint reality.
- **Baphomet**: Reconciliation of opposites (solve/coagula).
- **Pentagram & Hexagram**: Microcosm vs. macrocosm harmonics.
- **Tarot**: Initiatory map of Tree of Life.
- **Magical Chain**: How thought-emotion-image form influence loops.
- **Great Work**: Self-equilibration before mediating worlds.

## Ritual Kit
Wand (Will), Cup (Imagination), Sword (Discernment), Pentacle (Anchoring), Circle, Triangle, Names & Sigils, Banishing & Consecration.

## Initiatory Arc
1. Know  
2. Dare  
3. Will  
4. Keep Silent  

## TL;DR
**Balanced Will + Imagination imprint the Astral Light through symbol and rite--ethics keep it clean.**

# Layer: Transcendental Magic (Lévi) -- Keys, Seals, Currents

## What this is
The "operating system" of ceremonial magic: **Will + Imagination + Symbol**. Map Sephiroth/Arcana/Letters to actions. It's your symbol-engineering kit for grids, seals, attunements, and narrative locks.

## Core Mechanics
- **Will (Thelemic fire) + Imagination (Moon mirror) + Word/Sign (Mercury) = Change.**
- **As Above/Below:** Design every ritual with a **macro** (cosmic map) and **micro** (body map).
- **The Pentagram:** Microcosm control; four elements + spirit. Use for warding/opening.
- **Baphomet:** Union of opposites → stable charge. Use as *integration* archetype.
- **Arcana calculus:** Major Arcana as procedural steps (e.g., II High Priestess = veil/pause).

## Symbol → Action Table (quick)
- **Pentagram → boundary, start/stop scenes.**
- **Hexagram → invoke planetary force, boss mechanics.**
- **Tetragrammaton (YHVH) → element cycling: Fire→Water→Air→Earth loops.**
- **Sephiroth ladder → progression trees + skill gates.**

## Ritualized Use
- **Seal Fabrication:** pick intent → choose shape (5/6) → inscribe name (gematria optional) → charge (breath/chant).
- **Grid Attunement:** lay 4 elements + 1 spirit stones → clockwise walking → speak Name.

## For your Practice (reiki/arts)
- Bind Reiki symbols to **elemental quarters** for stronger container.
- Use Tarot as **session map** (pull 3 → open/work/close).

## Cross-refs
- Partners: **Book of Lies Layer** (paradox), **Morgan le Fay** (liminal witchcraft), **Scarlet Lady** (charge).
- Index Tag: `SEALS`, `ARCANA`, `WILL`, `IMAGINATION`

### TL;DR Summary
Lévi gives you a symbol engine. Combine Will, Imagination, and precise seals to move currents. Use the pentagram/hexagram, Arcana steps, and Name-work to structure both ritual and game systems.
