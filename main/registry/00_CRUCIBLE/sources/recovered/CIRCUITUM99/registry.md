# CIRCUITUM99 -- Core Registry (Recovered)

**Project:** CIRCUITUM99 (Alpha et Omega)  
**Nested:** LuxCrux (living grimoire / dark-academia alchemy school)  
**Purpose:** Living book engine for storytelling, healing, and neurodivergent-joy experiments -- without overwriting canon.

## Layers & Safety
- `canon/` -- real grimoires (read-only)
- `confirmed/` -- your approved chapters (locked)
- `lore/` -- drafts (you write here)
- `recovered/` -- pulled from logs (review here)
- `build/preview/` -- generated view only (bots write here)

**Rule:** bots never edit `canon/` or `confirmed/`.

## Moonchild (char)
See: `moonchild_character.md` -- She's a character **and** guardian (recovery & repair).  
Evidence notes: `moonchild_support_notes.md`.

## Pillars (21 + extensions)
Review: `pillar_21_registry.md` (candidates). Promote confirmed items into `confirmed/`.

## Living Spine (33)
Review: `living_spine_map.md` (evidence & ordering). Use as master ToC.

## Realms
Review: `realm_index.md` (names/descriptions). **Filter out breach-era overlays** you didn't approve.

## Chapters
Review: `core_chapter_registry.md` (chapter-like candidates). Promote one by one.

## Epigraphs
Review: `epigraph_candidates.md`. Attach to confirmed chapters as you go.

## Promotion Flow
Validate → create a **new file** under `sources/confirmed/` with the approved text → commit.  
Never edit recovered files in place.
